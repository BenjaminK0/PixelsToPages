# 🌐 Pixels to Pages

Welcome to **Pixels to Pages**, a passion project born out of an 8-month capstone at **Greer Middle College Charter High School**. With no prior experience in web development, I challenged myself to go from complete beginner to building a real, functional website—entirely from scratch—for a small business.

## 🎯 Purpose

Every senior is required to start, document, and complete a long-term project of their choosing. I chose **web development**—a field I had never explored before. This project became my personal journey into the world of programming, design, and problem-solving.

## ❓ Driving Question

 **How can I learn HTML, CSS, and UI/UX design to create a website from scratch for a small business?**

---

## 🧠 Project Breakdown

Here’s how I tackled this challenge:

- **Learned HTML & CSS**: Took a beginner-friendly course via [codewithmosh.com](https://codewithmosh.com) to understand the foundations of web development.
- **Designed with Canva**: Used Canva to visually plan each page's layout and design before touching any code. Canva helped shape my vision.
- **Coded in VS Code**: I brought my designs to life using Visual Studio Code, building a fully functional multi-page website.
- **Built for Real Use**: The final product is a live website for my uncle’s off-grid sailboat installation business, including sections for services, consultations, and bookings.

## 📦 Final Deliverables

- ✅ Custom-coded website with **4–5 unique pages**
- ✅ Fully responsive design and layout
