# Pixels to Pages
Purpose: Greer Middle College Charter High School requires the senior class to start, document, and finish an 8-month-long project of their choosing. This choice for me was web development. With no prior coding experience, I started from scratch. 

Driving Question: How can I learn HTML, CSS, and UI/UX design to create a website from scratch for a small business?

Project Proposal: I will learn how to program in HTML and CSS by taking an online course via codewithmosh.com. I
will then learn the software Canva to design a website from scratch. Canva is just to plan out the
different elements and how I want the website to look before I code it. Canva does not code
anything for me; its purpose is to be used as a blueprint for when I code my website in Microsoft’s
VS Code (a platform for writing code). I will then use both skills to develop a functional website with
4-5 pages that vary in design (consultation, about me, services, and a way to book appointments)
for my uncle’s off-grid sailboat installation business.
